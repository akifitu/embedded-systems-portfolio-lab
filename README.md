This repository is an embedded-systems portfolio designed to look credible on
GitHub before any real board is connected. The code is written in portable C,
builds on the host with a standard compiler, and models the kind of firmware
problems that show up in production teams.

## Why This Set Works on GitHub

- It covers control, reliability, and communications instead of only toy sensor code.
- Each project produces deterministic output that reviewers can inspect quickly.
- The repository is split into standalone subprojects that can later become separate repos.
