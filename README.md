This repository is an embedded-systems portfolio designed to look credible on
GitHub before any real board is connected. The code is written in portable C,
builds on the host with a standard compiler, and models the kind of firmware
problems that show up in production teams.

## Portfolio Signal

- Safety and control logic through a battery-management state machine
- Reliability and upgrade strategy through an A/B OTA bootloader model
- Bus communication literacy through a CAN telemetry scheduler
- Embedded diagnostics and fixed-point friendly DSP through a motor monitor
- Repeatability through `make test` and a GitHub Actions CI pipeline

phase=stall fault=STALL sev=CRITICAL rms=39 p2p=120 jerk=18 current=9800 temp=44.0C events=3
```

## Build

Build and test everything:

```sh
make all
make test
```

Run project demos:

```sh
make run-bms
make run-ota
make run-can
make run-motor
```

## Why This Set Works on GitHub

- It covers control, reliability, and communications instead of only toy sensor code.
- Each project produces deterministic output that reviewers can inspect quickly.
- The repository is split into standalone subprojects that can later become separate repos.

## Suggested Next Hardware Targets

- Port the BMS project to STM32 or ESP32 with ADC, GPIO, and contactor control
- Port the OTA simulator to Zephyr or MCUboot integration tests
- Bridge the CAN node to Linux `vcan` or a real MCP2515 transceiver
- Port the motor monitor to an accelerometer + DMA ADC capture chain on STM32
